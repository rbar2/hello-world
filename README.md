Hi,
Ryan Barone here.  Traveling is one of my favorite things to do.  So far, I have been to the US, Canada, Mexico, Australia, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Germany, Switzerland, France, Ireland, England, Thailand, and India!  I hope to continue traveling to new countries and understanding new cultures!
